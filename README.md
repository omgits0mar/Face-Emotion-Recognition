# Face Emotion Recognition
This project is a deep learning-based approach to face detection using Haar-cascade and emotion recognition based on facial expressions. It recognizes the person's emotion to one of the seven classes: neutral, sad, depressed, happy, surprised, feared, and disgust. The model is trained on the 
[FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013) using the MobileNetv2 architecture.

## Dataset
The [FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013) contains 35,887 grayscale images of faces labeled with one of the seven emotions. The images are 48x48 pixels in size.

## Methodology

The project consists of two main parts: face detection and emotion recognition. For face detection, we use Haar-cascade, which is a popular algorithm for detecting faces in images. For emotion recognition, we use a deep learning model based on the MobileNetv2 architecture. The model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset using Keras with TensorFlow backend.

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 94% on training set and 68% on the test set, which is competitive with other state-of-the-art models for emotion recognition.
